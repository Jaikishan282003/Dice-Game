The Dice Game project is an interactive web application built using React. It allows users to roll virtual dice and engage in a fun and dynamic gaming experience. The main features of the game include:

Dynamic Dice Rolling: Users can roll one or more dice, and the application generates random results for each roll.
Interactive UI: A clean and responsive user interface enhances user engagement, displaying dice animations and roll outcomes.
Score Tracking: The game can include optional score tracking for competitive gameplay between players or to set personal high scores.
State Management: React's state management is utilized to handle dice rolls, scores, and reset functionality.
Reusable Components: The application leverages reusable React components, making the code modular and easy to maintain.
This project demonstrates the use of React for creating interactive web applications, showcasing skills in JavaScript, component-based architecture, and modern web development practices.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
